## School Classification Questions

Before beginning an audit, establish the school's profile:

1. **Phase**: Primary / Secondary / All-through
2. **Governance type**: Community / Voluntary-controlled / Foundation / Voluntary-aided
3. **Key stages served**: [ ] KS1 [ ] KS2 [ ] KS4 [ ] KS5 (tick all that apply)
4. **Employee count**: Under 250 / 250 or more
5. **Has sixth form**: Yes / No
6. **Receives PE and sport premium**: Yes / No
7. **Receives pupil premium**: Yes / No
8. **Has school uniform requirement**: Yes / No

## Evidence Collection Principles

Evidence may take various forms depending on how the school presents information:

| Evidence Type | When to Use | What to Capture |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Screenshot** | Content displayed directly on webpage | Full page or relevant section showing the required information |
| **External link** | School links to official source (e.g., Ofsted, LA website) | Screenshot showing the link exists, plus verification the link works |
| **Downloaded document** | PDF, Word doc, or other file | The document itself, plus screenshot showing where it's linked from |
| **Multiple pages** | Information spread across several pages | Screenshots of each relevant page, noting navigation path |

**General principles:**
- Capture enough context to prove the information exists and is publicly accessible
- Record URLs for all evidence sources
- For downloadable documents, capture both the download link location and the document content
- Use descriptive filenames for organisation (suggested pattern: `{section-number:02d}-{criterion-slug}-{descriptor}.{ext}`)
