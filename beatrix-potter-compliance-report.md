## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Mandatory requirements not met

1. **Salary Statement (Criterion 19)**: The school must publish information about the number of employees earning over £100,000 gross annual salary, presented in £10,000 bandings. Even if no employees earn over £100,000, this must be explicitly stated (e.g., "No employees at this school have a gross annual salary of £100,000 or more"). This statement should be added to the Governors page or a dedicated Financial Information page.

### Priority 2: Mandatory requirements partially met

None identified.

### Priority 3: Recommended improvements

1. Consider adding a dedicated "Financial Information" page that consolidates the £100k salary statement and the Schools Financial Benchmarking link in one location.
2. Ensure all policy documents have review dates clearly visible.
