## Broken Links

During the assessment, the following issues were identified:

| Link URL | Linked From | Error | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| /Statutory-Policies/ | Main navigation bar | Page loads but contains no content ("This page is awaiting content") | N/A (navigation issue, not a broken link) |

The `/Statutory-Policies/` page linked from the main navigation bar is empty. The actual policies are located at `/Policies/` which is not directly linked from the main navigation. Users navigating to "Statutory Policies" from the menu will find an empty page.

No HTTP error pages (404, 500, etc.) were encountered during this assessment.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Mandatory requirements partially met

1. **Add salary disclosure statement (Criterion 9)**: Publish a statement about the number of employees earning over £100,000 in £10,000 bandings. Even if no staff earn above this threshold, the school must state "No employees have a gross annual salary of £100,000 or more." This could be added to the Financial Benchmarking page or the Governors page.

2. **Add RE withdrawal information (Criterion 7)**: Publish information about the parental right to withdraw children from Religious Education on the Curriculum page or as a separate statement.

3. **Add link to compare school performance service (Criterion 20)**: Add a link to https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/ on the Results page, along with a direct link to the school's specific performance page.

4. **Publish accessibility plan (Criterion 7/19)**: Publish an accessibility plan covering curriculum participation, physical environment improvements, and information accessibility. This may be within the SEND Information and Offer document but should be clearly identifiable.

### Priority 2: Recommended requirements partially met

5. **Add weekly hours total (Criterion 17)**: The School Times page shows daily start and end times but does not state the total weekly hours (including breaks, excluding after-school activities). Add a summary calculation.

### Priority 3: Recommended improvements

6. **Fix Statutory Policies navigation**: The "Statutory Policies" link in the main navigation leads to an empty page. Either populate this page or redirect to `/Policies/`.

7. **Resolve Chair of Governors inconsistency**: The Contact Us page lists Chair of Governors as Simon Rhoades, while the Governors page lists Colum Anglin as Chair. Update whichever is incorrect.

8. **Consider publishing a music development plan (Criterion 7)**: DfE recommends schools publish a music development plan.

### Broken Links to Fix

9. **Populate or redirect /Statutory-Policies/**: This page is linked from the main navigation but contains no content. Redirect to `/Policies/` or populate with the statutory policy documents.
